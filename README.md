CUSTOMER PORTAL

The customer portal on Bamazon has two functions:
1. View all available products
2. Buy a product selected by ID.




After selecting an item from the list, the user is displyed the item they selected and prompted for a quantity to purchase.



Once the user has selected their item and the quantity they would like to purchase, the database is checked for product availibility.
If the user has selected a quantity larger than what is in the DB, they will be notified to choose another option.

However, if the user quantity is less than what is in the DB, they will be notified that their item has been shipped and the DB quantity is updated.
